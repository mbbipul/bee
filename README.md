A web base project with Database(DB) named social media website for my 4th semester Lab project on DB.This web site is basically one kind of social communication media. There are currently many types of social communication media, our project is very much like that. But the features are different. Our Social Communication Media is basically based on the University Platform. This Social Communications Media is just affiliated with the University (such as teachers, students, many more), people can open their own personal account and communicate in the community. With the help of their University Teachers' account, they can easily send the class schedule to the students of a whole batch with only one message, and no student will have to individually message. It can be sent via email again. You can easily find a member through this media. Suppose you have no contact with any of your old friends, just you know your friend's education background or current, you can easily find your friend. There will be an option of search where you can search by the name of the institute or first country, then the area, then the university, then the faculty, then department name, then select the name with the selection. Finally, you can identify your friend's pictures or details. You will not get this easy process in any other social media and this facility.
